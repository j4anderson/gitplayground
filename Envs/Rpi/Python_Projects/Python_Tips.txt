-- exit
Cntl-D   or

>>> the_world_is_flat = 1

-- As a script:

chmod +x myscript.py
#! /usr/bin/env python3.2    or
#!/usr/bin/python3.2

also set your PATH variable to include the dir the script is in:
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`

-- Can customize every interpreted session by creating a file 
-- (usercustomize.py or sitecustomize.py) with custom code and 
-- putting it in the dir returned by:

>>> import site
>>> site.getusersitepackages()
'/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.2/site-packages'

-- Fibonacci generator:

>>> a, b =0,1
>>> while b<10:
	print(b)
	a,b=b, a+b


-- Get help:
help(print)   --> shows help for the print command

-- convert an integer into string for a print call
-- using the str() built-in function
b=4
print("list a has "+ str(b) +" slices.")
